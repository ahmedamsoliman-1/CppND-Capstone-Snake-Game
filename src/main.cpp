1. To begin, main creates a Controller, a Game, and a Renderer object. Game stores a Snake object as part of the state.
2. main calls Game::Run to start the game loop.

main.cpp
This is the entrypoint for the program. The main function in this file sets variables such as the window height and width and the number of frames per 
second at which the game will be played. The main also creates Renderer, Controller, and Game objects, and calls the Game::Run method to start the game 
loop.
